    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides machine learning tools in several categories. These include supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We'll start working with unsupervised learning next week. Supervised learning is about finding a model for features that can be measured and some labelling that we have for the available data. If, for example, we have lithium assays and we want to try to predict lithium based on sensor data from a portable spectrometer, then the lithium assays are the labels and the measured intensities at different wavelengths are the measured features. This kind of supervised learning is called regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another kind of supervised learned which is called classification, this is what we're doing when we want to assign observed data to different discrete classes. Regression can sometimes be used, with minor additions, to classify data as well. For example, with our lithium spectral regression model we could classify samples as being high in lithium or low in lithium simply by using a threshold value that we set. There are more sophisticated ways to classify, which will be covered in later weeks.\n",
